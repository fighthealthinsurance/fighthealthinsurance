If you buy your health insurance through Healthcare.gov or your state’s health insurance Marketplace, your monthly bills could be up to [75% higher](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5471281/aca-health-insurance-premiums-obamacare-bbb-kff) in 2026. That’s because premiums are going up and enhanced federal subsidies are likely to end.

Insurance companies are proposing the largest premium increases in nearly a decade. The median insurer has proposed an 18% increase, while the average is about [20%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers), according to a recent [analysis](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers) of 312 insurance plans. Some insurers are considering an increase of nearly [59%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers). 

Many people on ACA marketplace plans receive a subsidy. But if the federal government doesn’t extend enhanced subsidies ([available](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans) for individuals making [under](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd73d4f00d8a819d10b2fdb70d254f7b/detailed-guidelines-2025.pdf) $62,600 and a family of four making under $128,600), people will see their out-of-pocket premiums jump even more. 

For example, consider a person making $45,000 a year. With the current enhanced subsidies, they pay $150 a month for their plan. If the plan’s premium increases by 20% and the enhanced subsidies expire, their monthly payment could jump to over $400 for the same coverage. That's an extra $3,000 a year.

The changes aren’t final yet, but you can take steps now to protect your coverage.

### What to Do About Health Insurance Costs

Here’s what to do now to prepare. 

- **Make Sure Your Contact Information Is Up to Date:** Log into your Marketplace account or state ACA portal and confirm your mailing address, email, and phone number. You’ll need to receive renewal notices and subsidy updates without delay.
- **Report Any Income or Household Changes Quickly:** If you lose income, have a child, or otherwise see your circumstances change, updating your application could increase your subsidy and lower your premium.
- **Consider Shopping Around During Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment Periods:** Increases vary widely by insurer, and switching plans could save you hundreds of dollars a year. If Congress extends subsidies or your income changes mid-year, you might be able to switch to a lower-cost plan before 2026 ends.
- **Check If You Qualify for Medicaid or CHIP:** In many states, if your income is below certain limits, you may qualify for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which can offer free or low-cost coverage year-round.
- **Seek Free Assistance:** Licensed navigators and other assisters can help you through options. You can find them at [HealthCare.gov/localhelp](http://HealthCare.gov/localhelp) or by calling 1-800-318-2596.

Staying insured in 2026 without breaking the bank will require some proactive planning. While the prospect of rising premiums and expiring subsidies is daunting, you have several tools at your disposal. By verifying your contact information, exploring different plans during open enrollment, and checking your eligibility for programs like Medicaid or CHIP, you can take control of your healthcare costs. Don't wait for the changes to hit — start preparing now to ensure you maintain affordable coverage.
