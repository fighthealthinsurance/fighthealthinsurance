If you buy your health insurance through Healthcare.gov or your state’s health insurance Marketplace, your monthly bills could be up to [75% higher](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5471281/aca-health-insurance-premiums-obamacare-bbb-kff) in 2026. That’s because premiums are going up and enhanced federal subsidies are likely to end.

Insurance companies are proposing the largest premium increases in nearly a decade, with the medium insurer raising prices by about [20%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers), according to a recent [analysis](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers) of 312 insurance plans. Some insurers are considering an increase of nearly [50%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers). 

Many people on ACA marketplace plans receive a subsidy. But if the federal government doesn’t extend enhanced subsidies ([available](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans) for individuals making [under](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd73d4f00d8a819d10b2fdb70d254f7b/detailed-guidelines-2025.pdf) $62,600 and a family of four making under $128,600), people will see their out-of-pocket premiums jump even more. The changes aren’t final yet, but you can take steps now to protect your coverage.

### What to Do About Health Insurance Costs

Here’s what to do now to prepare. 

- **Make Sure Your Contact Information Is Up to Date:** Log into your Marketplace account or state ACA portal and confirm your mailing address, email, and phone number. You’ll need to receive renewal notices and subsidy updates without delay.
- **Report Any Income or Household Changes Quickly:** If you lose income, have a child, or otherwise see your circumstances change, updating your application could increase your subsidy and lower your premium.
- **Consider Shopping Around During Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment Periods:** Increases vary widely by insurer, and switching plans could save you hundreds of dollars a year. If Congress extends subsidies or your income changes mid-year, you might be able to switch to a lower-cost plan before 2026 ends.
- **Check If You Qualify for Medicaid or CHIP:** In many states, if your income is below certain limits, you may qualify for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which can offer free or low-cost coverage year-round.
- **Seek Free Assistance:** Licensed navigators and other assisters can help you through options. You can find them at [HealthCare.gov/localhelp](http://HealthCare.gov/localhelp) or by calling 1-800-318-2596.
