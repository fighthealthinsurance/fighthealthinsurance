If you buy your health insurance through HealthCare.gov or your state’s health insurance Marketplace, your out-of-pocket premiums could rise by an average of more than [75%](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5471281/aca-health-insurance-premiums-obamacare-bbb-kff) in 2026 if Congress lets the enhanced premium subsidies expire. That’s on top of underlying premium increases insurers have proposed.

Insurance companies are proposing the largest premium increases in nearly a decade. The median insurer has proposed an 18% increase, while the average is about [20%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers), according to a recent [analysis](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers) of 312 insurance plans. Some insurers are considering an increase of nearly [59%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/#Distribution%20of%20proposed%202026%20rate%20changes%20among%20312%20ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers). 

Many people on ACA marketplace plans receive subsidies through enhanced premium tax credits ([ARPA/IRA](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/feb/enhanced-premium-tax-credits-aca-health-plans)), which increased financial help and extended eligibility above 400% of the federal poverty level ([FPL](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd73d4f00d8a819d10b2fdb70d254f7b/detailed-guidelines-2025.pdf)) by capping benchmark premiums at 8.5% of income. For 2025, 400% FPL is $62,600 for an individual and $128,600 for a family of four in the contiguous U.S., but people above those amounts can still qualify for help. If Congress does not extend these enhanced subsidies beyond 2025, out-of-pocket premiums will jump for many enrollees. The changes aren't final yet, but you can take steps now to protect your coverage.

### What to Do About Health Insurance Costs

Here’s what to do now to prepare. 

- **Make Sure Your Contact Information Is Up to Date:** Log into your Marketplace account or state ACA portal and confirm your mailing address, email, and phone number. You’ll need to receive renewal notices and subsidy updates without delay.
- **Report Any Income or Household Changes Quickly:** If you lose income, have a child, or otherwise see your circumstances change, updating your application could increase your subsidy and lower your premium.
- **Consider Shopping Around During Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment Periods:** Increases vary widely by insurer, and switching plans could save you hundreds of dollars a year. If Congress extends subsidies or your income changes mid-year, you might be able to switch to a lower-cost plan before 2026 ends.
- **Check If You Qualify for Medicaid or CHIP:** In many states, if your income is below certain limits, you may qualify for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which can offer free or low-cost coverage year-round.
- **Seek Free Assistance:** Licensed navigators and other assisters can help you through options. You can find them at [HealthCare.gov/localhelp](http://HealthCare.gov/localhelp) or by calling 1-800-318-2596.

Staying insured in 2026 without breaking the bank will require some proactive planning. While the prospect of rising premiums and expiring subsidies is daunting, you have several tools at your disposal. By verifying your contact information, exploring different plans during open enrollment, and checking your eligibility for programs like Medicaid or CHIP, you can take control of your healthcare costs. Don't wait for the changes to hit — start preparing now to ensure you maintain affordable coverage.
