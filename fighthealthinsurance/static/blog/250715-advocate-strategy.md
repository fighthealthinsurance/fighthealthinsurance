When health insurance denies a claim, most people react with confusion, frustration, and often resignation. For me, that’s just the beginning of a process I know well.

My method isn’t based on insider access or legal training — it’s based on persistence, careful documentation, and strategic follow-up.

I’m not a lawyer or an insurance expert. I’m a veteran high school physics teacher, a nonprofit founder for [SPDA](https://disordersofaggression.org/), and a parent who has spent years fighting to make insurance companies pay what they owe. Over time, I’ve become an informal advocate for friends and family, helping them push through the system and claim what’s rightfully theirs.

My message is simple: **You can get what you deserve, but you have to learn how to fight.**

## Why Phone Calls Usually Don’t Help Much

The number one mistake people make is getting tangled up in long phone calls.

It might feel natural to call the insurance company, but I caution against it. Phone calls are undocumented, inconsistent, and often lead nowhere. Customer service reps are frequently unclear or give conflicting answers. Only call for very concrete, non-controversial information — like to verify a correct phone number, address, or department or person to speak to.

My advice: **keep your communications in writing**. Submit claim materials using the insurance company’s online portal, and also send a hard copy via certified mail. Save every piece of correspondence, and log what you submitted, when, how and through what method it was sent.

**Paperwork wins cases**. The more organized and complete your documentation, the harder it is for them to deny your claim without consequences.

## My Process That Works

Over the years, I’ve developed a system that works. It’s not theoretical — it’s a step-by-step approach that has helped me recover tens of thousands of dollars.

Here’s what I do:

- ✅ **Fill claim forms completely.** Include the provider’s bill with treatment codes, the claim form, and any necessary documentation like referrals or prior authorizations. Submit online and send a hard copy by certified mail.
- ✅ **Track the time.** I typically wait 21 days. If I see no progress or payment via mail or online portal, I prepare to escalate.
- ✅ **File a grievance.** Every insurer must offer a grievance process. I resubmit my materials — clearly numbered and organized — with a written explanation of the issue.
- ✅ **Escalate the complaint.** If the grievance isn’t resolved within the legal time frame (usually 30–45 days), I contact my state’s Department of Managed Health Care or the equivalent oversight agency.

It’s not fast, and it takes effort. But it works.

## The Value of Records

I’ve built entire cases around detailed records.

In one dispute with Delta Dental, I submitted 22 pages of documentation to back up her claim: medical records, bills, prior approvals, correspondence, and multiple copies of my son’s written authorization for me to act on his behalf.

Even after I sent this information several times, they claimed documents were missing or approvals hadn’t been granted. But I could prove otherwise — showing exact copies of what I sent, when, and who received it.

**They claimed I hadn’t submitted my son’s authorization. I sent it three separate times.** That isn’t confusion — it’s a tactic. They want you to give up.

I didn’t. I escalated the case to the Florida Department of Insurance, and it was resolved.

## When Legal Action Is Necessary

One of my biggest victories came after Blue Cross refused to reimburse me for my son’s out-of-network hospitalization.

After receiving no payment at all — and then a laughable 1% offer after a grievance — I took legal action.

I contacted a law firm and found an attorney who would take the case on contingency. I already had everything they needed. My documentation was complete.

We won. The final payout covered the entire bill and more.

Individual lawsuits are rare and difficult. But when you’re organized and persistent, it’s possible.

## Practical Help for Others

I’m not a formal advocate. I don’t represent clients or negotiate on their behalf. What I do is help people understand **what steps to take and how to protect themselves.**

Here’s my core advice boils down to:

- Communicate in writing whenever possible
- Submit all documents by two trackable methods (for example, portal + certified mail)
- Keep detailed logs and save copies of everything
- Number your pages and reference them clearly
- File grievances if the company fails to respond
- Escalate to state regulators if internal processes stall

Success doesn’t come from specialized knowledge — it comes from strategy and endurance.

**Most people get overwhelmed. That’s exactly what insurance companies hope for. They want you to walk away because it saves them money.**

## Why This Matters

I don’t do this because I enjoy conflict. I do it because I believe the system is designed to discourage people from claiming what they’ve already paid for.

No one gets medical care as a luxury. We go because we’re sick, because we need help. To then be denied reimbursement, to be ignored or stalled — it’s unacceptable.

If I can help someone get what they deserve, that’s reason enough to keep going.

My story is proof that persistence, preparation, and paperwork can shift the odds — even in a system designed to confuse and delay. For anyone facing a denied claim, I want you to know: **there is a way to fight back. And it works.**
