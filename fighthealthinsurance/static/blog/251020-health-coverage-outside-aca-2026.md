When people talk about individual health insurance, the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/) marketplace tends to dominate the conversation. But there are other types of coverage that exist outside (or partially outside) of ACA rules. These alternatives often promise lower costs or greater flexibility — but they come with trade-offs in protection and reliability. And in 2026, regulatory and market changes may shift how viable these options are.

This post breaks down the main alternatives to ACA marketplace plans, how they work, and what's changing in the year ahead.

## Alternative Health Coverage Options

### Short-term / Limited Duration Plans
**What it is:** Temporary insurance policies not required to follow ACA rules (often lasting 3 months, sometimes renewable).

**Advantages:** Lower cost, available outside open enrollment.

**Risks/Limitations:** May exclude preexisting conditions, cap benefits, deny coverage, or carry high out-of-pocket costs.

**2026 Outlook:** Federal agencies have signaled [non-enforcement of stricter duration limits](https://hrexecutive.com/return-of-short-term-health-insurance/), potentially allowing coverage up to three years in some states. [Iowa already permits up to 3 years](https://iid.iowa.gov/).

---

### Fixed-Benefit / Indemnity Plans
**What it is:** Pay a set dollar amount per service (e.g., $200 per hospital day) rather than covering a percentage of costs.

**Advantages:** Predictable benefit, can supplement other coverage.

**Risks/Limitations:** Gaps between payment and actual costs can be huge; limited benefits.

**2026 Outlook:** No major regulatory changes expected in 2026.

---

### Association Health Plans
**What it is:** Groups (e.g., trade associations) band together to buy insurance, sometimes outside ACA's individual market rules.

**Advantages:** Pooling of risk, potentially lower costs.

**Risks/Limitations:** Subject to state restrictions, may offer fewer protections.

**2026 Outlook:** Future depends on state and federal policy, especially oversight of risk pooling.

---

### Health Care Sharing Ministries
**What it is:** Faith-based groups where members share each other's medical bills (not insurance).

**Advantages:** Low monthly cost, community appeal.

**Risks/Limitations:** No guarantee of payment, no regulatory oversight, can exclude many conditions.

**2026 Outlook:** Continue to operate outside ACA; stability varies widely.

---

### Excepted Benefits (Supplemental Plans)
**What it is:** Limited scope products (dental, vision, accident, critical illness).

**Advantages:** Useful add-ons, can be purchased separately.

**Risks/Limitations:** Not comprehensive — won't cover major medical needs.

**2026 Outlook:** Unlikely to see regulatory changes in 2026.

---

### Grandfathered / Legacy Plans
**What it is:** Pre-ACA plans that have avoided major changes and thus remain exempt from many ACA rules.

**Advantages:** Continuity of coverage for some enrollees.

**Risks/Limitations:** Often lack newer protections (e.g., preventive services).

**2026 Outlook:** Pool continues to shrink, as plans that make significant changes lose their status; natural attrition reduces the total number over time.

## ACA vs Alternatives: What's Different?

- **Protections**: ACA requires coverage of 10 essential health benefits, preventive care, and prohibits lifetime limits. Alternatives often skip these.

- **Preexisting Conditions**: ACA bans discrimination; many alternatives can underwrite or deny coverage.

- **Subsidies**: Only ACA marketplace plans qualify for [premium tax credits](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/premium-tax-credit/) and cost-sharing reductions.

- **Enrollment Windows**: ACA plans have set open enrollment periods. Some alternatives can be purchased year-round.

- **Risk Exposure**: Alternatives may leave enrollees with major uncovered costs.

## What's Changing in 2026

### 1. ACA Premium Increases
Marketplace insurers have proposed median [premium hikes of ~18% for 2026](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/aca-marketplace-premiums-in-2026/). Rising costs may push more consumers to look at alternatives.

### 2. Expiration of Enhanced Subsidies
The [enhanced premium tax credits](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/aca-marketplace-premiums-in-2026/) under the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. Without renewal, average net premiums could more than double for many.

### 3. Insurer Exits
[CVS/Aetna will withdraw from ACA marketplaces in 2026](https://www.ajmc.com/view/aetna-to-exit-aca-marketplace-in-2026), affecting about 1 million enrollees in 17 states. Fewer insurers could mean higher prices and fewer choices.

### 4. Expanded Access to Catastrophic Plans
[CMS announced that consumers will gain expanded access](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/expanding-access-health-insurance-consumers-gain-access-catastrophic-health-insurance-plans-2026) to ACA-compliant catastrophic plans in 2026. These are high-deductible options aimed at younger, healthier consumers.

### 5. Short-Term Plans Loosening
Federal agencies are easing enforcement of strict duration limits, and some states are explicitly permitting longer policies. This may make short-term coverage more common again.

## Questions to Ask Before Choosing an Alternative

- What does my state allow or prohibit?

- Will my health status impact eligibility or premiums?

- What benefits are covered — and what caps exist?

- How long does the plan last, and can it be renewed?

- How does the cost compare to ACA plans after subsidies?

- Will enrolling in this plan affect my eligibility for ACA subsidies later?

- Who is backing the plan — is it financially reliable?

## The Bottom Line

ACA plans remain the gold standard for protections, subsidies, and comprehensive coverage. But in 2026, with premiums rising, subsidies set to expire, and insurer exits looming, some consumers may be tempted by alternatives. These can be useful as temporary bridges or supplements, but they often expose people to serious financial risk.

If you're considering alternatives in 2026, read the fine print carefully — and understand that cheaper up front may mean costlier in the long run.
