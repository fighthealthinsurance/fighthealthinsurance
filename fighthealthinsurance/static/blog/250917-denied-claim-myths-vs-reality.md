When that dreaded insurance denial letter shows up, it's easy to think: "That's it. Game over." But the truth is far more hopeful. Let's bust some of the most common myths about health insurance denials.

<img src="/static/images/fhi-myth-reality.png" alt="Myth vs Reality: Health Insurance Denials" style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

## Myth #1: A denial is the end of the road

**Reality**: A denial is just the beginning of the appeals process. Many people never challenge their denial ‚Äî but those who do often win. In fact, [prior authorization denials](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/over-35-million-prior-authorization-requests-were-submitted-to-medicare-advantage-plans-in-2021/) in Medicare Advantage get overturned approximately 83.2% of the time when appealed (KFF/CMS, 2022). Even in ACA marketplace plans, [internal appeal overturn rates](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) reached approximately 41% (2021) and 44% (2023), though this varies significantly by issuer and external appeals remain rare (KFF, 2023).

üëâ **Translation**: don't throw that denial letter away.

## Myth #2: The process is too complicated to be worth it

**Reality**: Yes, appeals involve paperwork and persistence ‚Äî but they're designed to be accessible. Federal ACA rules guarantee your right to both internal and external reviews for ACA-compliant plans, though exceptions exist (such as grandfathered plans, short-term limited-duration plans, and employer self-insured plans that may have different processes). Medicare and Medicaid use separate appeal systems. Tools like Fight Health Insurance can help navigate appeals for eligible plans ‚Äî check your plan type to confirm which appeal rights apply to you. Skipping an appeal could mean leaving thousands of dollars in care unpaid.

‚è∞ **Time matters**: Every denial letter includes a deadline to appeal ‚Äî typically 60 days for internal appeals and 60 days for external appeals in ACA plans, though timeframes vary by plan type. Missing that window can mean losing your right to challenge the denial, no matter how strong your case.

## Myth #3: Denials only happen for medical necessity

**Reality**: Not true. Many denials happen because of missing paperwork, coding errors, or administrative issues. Those are often the easiest wins on appeal once you submit the right documentation. Don't assume your denial is ironclad ‚Äî sometimes it's just a clerical mistake.

## Myth #4: If your first appeal fails, you're out of options

**Reality**: Most ACA-compliant plans offer multiple levels of appeal. After an internal appeal, you may have the right to an independent external review. Many people give up after one try ‚Äî but persistence can pay off. Data shows that fewer than 10% of Medicare Advantage denials are appealed, but when they are, [overturn rates exceed 80%](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/over-35-million-prior-authorization-requests-were-submitted-to-medicare-advantage-plans-in-2021/) (KFF/CMS, 2022).

## Why This Matters

[Less than 1% of denied claims](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) in ACA marketplace plans are ever appealed (KFF, 2023).

Among the ones that are, a large share succeed.

That means millions of people are paying for care out of pocket when they didn't have to.

Don't be one of them.

## Bottom Line

A denial isn't final. It's a hurdle ‚Äî and one you can often clear. Whether it's a small coding issue or a major treatment authorization, appealing your denial is worth the effort. Just remember: deadlines are tight, so act fast.
