When that dreaded insurance denial letter shows up, it's easy to think: "That's it. Game over." But the truth is far more hopeful. Let's bust some of the most common myths about health insurance denials.

## Myth #1: A denial is the end of the road

**Reality**: A denial is just the beginning of the appeals process. Many people never challenge their denial ‚Äî but those who do often win. In fact, [prior authorization denials](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/prior-authorization/ama-prior-authorization-physician-survey) in Medicare Advantage get overturned more than 80% of the time when appealed (AMA, 2022). Even in ACA marketplace plans, [appeal success rates](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) can range from 40‚Äì75% depending on the case and the level of review (KFF, 2023).

üëâ **Translation**: don't throw that denial letter away.

## Myth #2: The process is too complicated to be worth it

**Reality**: Yes, appeals involve paperwork and persistence ‚Äî but they're designed to be accessible. Federal law guarantees your right to both internal and external reviews. And tools (like Fight Health Insurance) exist to make the process smoother. Skipping an appeal could mean leaving thousands of dollars in care unpaid.

‚è∞ **Time matters**: Every denial letter includes a deadline to appeal ‚Äî often 30‚Äì180 days. Missing that window can mean losing your right to challenge the denial, no matter how strong your case.

## Myth #3: Denials only happen for medical necessity

**Reality**: Not true. Many denials happen because of missing paperwork, coding errors, or administrative issues. Those are often the easiest wins on appeal once you submit the right documentation. Don't assume your denial is ironclad ‚Äî sometimes it's just a clerical mistake.

## Myth #4: If your first appeal fails, you're out of options

**Reality**: Most plans offer multiple levels of appeal. After an internal appeal, you may have the right to an independent external review. Many people give up after one try ‚Äî but persistence can pay off. Data from Medicare Advantage shows that fewer than 10% of denials are appealed, but among those that are, [over 80% are overturned](https://www.investopedia.com/medicare-advantage-claim-denials-5323982) (Investopedia, 2024).

## Why This Matters

[Less than 1% of denied claims](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) in ACA marketplace plans are ever appealed (KFF, 2023).

Among the ones that are, a large share succeed.

That means millions of people are paying for care out of pocket when they didn't have to.

Don't be one of them.

## Bottom Line

A denial isn't final. It's a hurdle ‚Äî and one you can often clear. Whether it's a small coding issue or a major treatment authorization, appealing your denial is worth the effort. Just remember: deadlines are tight, so act fast.
