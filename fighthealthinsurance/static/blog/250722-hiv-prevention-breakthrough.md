**A twice‑yearly shot can prevent HIV, here's how to make sure it costs you nothing.**

In the United States, hundreds of people are infected with HIV every week. Last year, scientists achieved a major breakthrough: a drug backed by decades of research was shown to prevent virtually all infections with just two shots a year. That means no more forgetting to take a pill or worrying about getting a refill. Last month, the FDA approved the drug, known as lenacapavir.

In the United States, the drug will be known by its brand name, Yeztugo. It's a big win for HIV prevention; if people can get it. While the generic version would cost about $40 a year to make, the drug's manufacturer Gilead plans to set the list price at $28,000 a year. It's expected to launch in early 2026, and here's what to know about accessing it.

## If You're On Private Insurance

When Yeztugo appears on your plan's drug list, the pharmacy counter price should be $0. That's because if you're on private insurance, no cost coverage is legally required.

Most job‑based and Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans already cover existing PrEP options (e.g., Truvada, Descovy) with no out‑of‑pocket costs since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gives PrEP an "A" rating. As the Supreme Court confirmed last month in Kennedy v. Braidwood, insurers must cover every "A" or "B" preventive service without any copay, deductible, or prior authorization.

Federal guidance tells plans that "effective antiretroviral PrEP" means all FDA‑approved PrEP drugs. Because Yeztugo is not yet specifically named in the USPSTF's recommendation, some uncertainty remains about exactly when insurers will be required to provide $0 cost coverage.

In reality, some insurers still try to impose hurdles like prior‑authorization, step therapy, or cost‑sharing. They might try to delay the rollout of the drug. If you see a copay or additional barriers like prior authorization, you may want to consider an appeal.

## If You're on Medicare or Medicaid

Medicare has already added Yeztugo to its no‑cost preventive‑service list. That means no copay and no coinsurance.

Medicaid is also expected to cover Yeztugo for HIV prevention, but each state's Medicaid program must update its formulary, so access may not be immediate.

## If You Don't Have Insurance

If you're uninsured, the high cost of Yeztugo can be a major barrier. You may be eligible for free medication through the manufacturer's patient assistance program. You can find more information at [https://prep.advancingaccess.com](https://prep.advancingaccess.com) or by calling 1-800-226-2056.

## Know Your Rights

This breakthrough medication represents a major step forward in HIV prevention, but accessing it shouldn't be a battle. Whether you're on private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or uninsured, there are pathways to get Yeztugo at little to no cost.

**Don't let insurance barriers stop you from protecting your health.** If you encounter denials, unexpected costs, or prior authorization requirements, remember that you have options. Document everything, file appeals when necessary, and don't hesitate to escalate to your state insurance department if needed.

Prevention is healthcare at its most effective — and it's your right to access it.
