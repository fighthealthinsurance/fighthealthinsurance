If you rely on ACA marketplace health insurance for gender-affirming care, a major change is coming in 2026. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has [finalized](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/25/2025-11606/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-marketplace-integrity-and-affordability) a rule that removes gender-affirming services, such as hormone therapy, and certain procedures, from the list of "essential health benefits" (EHBs) that marketplace plans must cover.

This doesn't ban coverage. But it means [plans](https://www.them.us/story/trump-trans-health-care-benefits-costs) that keep covering gender-affirming care can set higher out-of-pocket costs, impose stricter approval processes, or drop coverage entirely. You also won't get the same cost-sharing protections you currently have for EHBs, like having expenses count toward your deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. 

People who live in certain states, such as California, Colorado, New Mexico, Vermont, and Washington, may still have [protections](https://shvs.org/new-federal-rules-affecting-coverage-of-treatment-for-gender-dysphoria-considerations-for-states/) because these states require insurance to cover gender-affirming care by law.

## What You Can Do Now

- **Check Your State's Rules**: Look up your state's ACA "benchmark plan" and laws. If your state mandates gender-affirming care coverage, your protections remain intact. State insurance department websites often have this information.

- **Review Your Current Plan's Policy**: Read your plan's benefits booklet or call customer service to confirm how it covers gender-affirming services now. 

- **Know Your Appeal Rights**: If a service is denied, you can file an appeal. Fight Health Insurance can help you write an appeal to fight a health insurance denial.
