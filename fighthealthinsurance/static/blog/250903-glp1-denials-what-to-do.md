GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, and others are well-known for their effectiveness in supporting weight loss and treating diabetes. They work by [regulating](https://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2025/04/how-glp-1-drugs-help-your-whole-body) appetite, and are recommended by the [American Diabetes Association](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2023/08/31/13/13/cardiovascular-disease-and-risk) to reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes. But insurance denials for these drugs are more common than ever, even for people who met approval criteria in past years. 

The insurance landscape for GLP-1s is confusing — one doctor [called](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/24/weight-loss-drugs-insurance-coverage/) it "absolutely insane." If your insurance recently denied your prescription, you're not alone. Here's what's happening, what's changing, and steps you can take to improve your chances of approval.

## The Landscape of GLP-1 Coverage

Doctors report that coverage decisions for GLP-1s are changing month-to-month, leaving patients caught in the middle. You [might](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/24/weight-loss-drugs-insurance-coverage/) qualify one year and be denied the next. In some cases, plans that covered Zepbound last year now only cover Wegovy, or vice versa, based on deals between insurance companies and drugmakers. 

Before you can get access, many insurance companies require "[prior authorization](https://info.primarycare.hms.harvard.edu/perspectives/articles/glp-1-pharmacy-perspective)," where your health care provider must obtain approval from the insurance company. Typically, eligibility for GLP-1 medications for weight loss is based on BMI scores, but insurance companies may require additional conditions like uncontrolled hypertension. Coverage for GLP-1s to treat type 2 diabetes is less restrictive, but many patients still need to submit prior authorizations.  

Patients who do get coverage are often hit with more requirements, like "[step therapy](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/mounjaro-step-therapy)" or trying cheaper alternatives first, or lowering doses and restarting at reduced doses after a gap. 

## Changes to Coverage

Many insurance plans are [tightening](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/01/health/zepbound-wegovy-insurance-cvs-bcbs-weight-loss) requirements in 2025. Insurers cite a number of changes to potentially tighten coverage to GLP-1s to treat type 2 diabetes and weight loss. For one, these drugs are expensive, and even the cheapest options can still amount to [hundreds](https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/cost-of-popular-weight-loss-drugs-goes-down-for-people-without-insurance/) of dollars per month. Moreover, because weight loss drugs aren't considered "essential health benefits" under the Affordable Care Act, coverage is [optional](https://www.verrill-law.com/blog/the-glp-1-coverage-conundrum-managing-costs-for-group-health-plans/). 

Some states are [exploring](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/capitol-journal/b/state-net/posts/states-consider-requiring-insurers-to-cover-weight-loss-drugs) requiring their ACA-compliant plans or state employee health plans/Medicaid to cover GLP-1 drugs, but few of these laws have passed yet.  

## Here's What To Do 

Ask for the denial letter and review the reason given. Consider going over your medical records, reviewing your insurer's requirements, and filing an appeal. Fight Health Insurance can help you write an appeal to fight a health insurance denial.
