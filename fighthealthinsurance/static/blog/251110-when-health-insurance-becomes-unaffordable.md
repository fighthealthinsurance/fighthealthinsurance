The language matters: People aren't "opting out" of [health insurance](https://www.healthcare.gov/) when their premium jumps from $2,494 to $4,793 overnight. They're being priced out.

<img src="/static/images/aca-2026-steps.png" alt="What to do when health insurance becomes unaffordable" style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

That's what happened to a California family of four whose Blue Shield renewal notice went viral on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), Nov. 2025). The $2,299 monthly increase wasn't just an insurer rate hike; it combined a $542 base premium increase with the potential loss of $1,757 in [federal subsidies](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/subsidy/).

Starting in 2026, millions of Americans will face similar shocks as [enhanced ACA subsidies](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/what-happens-if-the-enhanced-aca-marketplace-subsidies-expire/), which have kept premiums affordable since 2021, expire at the end of 2025. We covered this trend in our August post on [ACA insurance costs rising in 2026](https://www.fighthealthinsurance.com/blog/250803-aca-insurance-cost-increase-in-2026/), and since there are still no signs these subsidies will be extended, we're sharing more details on what to do if you're among those affected. Without them, premium payments are expected to more than double on average, jumping 114% from 2025 to 2026, according to [Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) analysis](https://www.kff.org/).

For some families, this means impossible choices. Ashley Thompson of Austin, Texas is weighing whether to drop coverage for herself and her husband while keeping their two children insured. Their premium could triple from $1,200 to $3,553 monthly ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/), Nov. 2025). Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Kansas, already pays a significant portion of his family's income for coverage; now he's facing another $400 per month increase ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/), Nov. 2025).

The [Congressional Budget Office (CBO)](https://www.cbo.gov/), which estimates that permanently extending the enhanced premium tax credits beyond 2025 would increase coverage by about 3.8 million people, implies that if those subsidies expire, roughly the same number could lose coverage (CBO, 2025 projections). Many more will downgrade to plans with higher deductibles and narrower networks, or cobble together alternatives that leave dangerous gaps.

If you're staring at an unaffordable premium for 2026, here's what you need to know before making any decisions.

## Act Now: Key Deadlines

[Open enrollment](https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines/) for 2026 coverage ends December 15, 2025 in most states (check your state for the exact timing because it could be earlier or later into January). California's [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/), for instance, requires applications by the end of October. This is your window to:

Compare plans with current vs. new subsidy levels

Switch to a more affordable option

Confirm you're getting all available assistance

Don't wait. The difference between acting now and scrambling in January could mean months without coverage or missing enrollment entirely ([HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/)).

## 1. Recalculate Your Subsidies (Even If You Think You Won't Qualify)

The enhanced subsidies made everyone earning up to 400% of the [federal poverty level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines) eligible for help and capped premiums at 8.5% of income for those above that threshold. Without them, many middle-income families will see subsidies drop dramatically or disappear. Roughly 92% of ACA marketplace enrollees—about 22 million people—currently receive these enhanced premium subsidies, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/), Nov. 2025.

But you still might qualify under the original ACA structure:

Individuals earning up to ~$60,240

Families of four earning up to ~$124,800

Small changes matter enormously. Matthew Espinoza, a 46-year-old San Francisco fitness instructor, nursing student, and restaurant server, expects to earn between $60,000 and $65,000 next year—right at the subsidy cliff ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), 2025).

| Household Type | Annual Income | % of FPL | 2025 Monthly Premium | 2026 Monthly Premium (without enhanced subsidies) | Annual Increase |
|----------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Single, Age 27 | $22,000 | 140% | $0 | $66 | $792 |
| Single, Age 40 | $50,000 | 318% | ~$200 | ~$367 | ~$2,000 |
| Single, Age 60 | $50,000 | 318% | ~$300 | ~$700 | ~$4,800 |
| Couple, Ages 60 | $85,000 | 402% | ~$600 | ~$2,600 | ~$24,000 |
| Family of 4 | $65,000 | 200% | ~$400 | ~$900 | ~$6,000 |
| Family of 4 | $100,000 | 308% | ~$700 | ~$1,600 | ~$10,800 |
| Family of 4 | $129,000 | 397% | ~$900 | ~$1,900 | ~$12,000 |

### Key Takeaways from the Table:

Those earning 100-400% of FPL will see the most dramatic increases

Older individuals face significantly higher premiums at every income level

Families just below the 400% FPL threshold will still qualify for some subsidies under original ACA, but far less than in 2025

Anyone above 400% FPL (~$63,000 for individuals, ~$129,000 for families of 4) loses all subsidies

Use the updated calculator at [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/lower-costs/) or your state exchange. Run the numbers for 2026—don't assume based on 2025. Small changes in income, dependents aging out, job changes, deductible medical expenses, or even how you file taxes can all affect eligibility.

## 2. Compare Every Plan Available to You

If your current plan is suddenly unaffordable, don't just drop coverage—shop aggressively. Insurers are charging 26% more on average for 2026 ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/), Nov. 2025).

**Evaluate total cost, not just premiums**: A plan with a $200 higher monthly premium but a $3,000 lower deductible could save you money if you need care.

**Review catastrophic and high-deductible plans**: Lower premiums, coverage for major medical emergencies.

**Check different metal tiers**: Bronze = lowest premiums, highest out-of-pocket costs; Silver = more balanced. For chronic conditions, Silver may cost less overall.

## 3. Explore Other Coverage Pathways

**Medicaid**: If your income has dropped, you might now qualify. States that chose to [expand Medicaid coverage](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/national-medicaid-chip-program-information/medicaid-childrens-health-insurance-program-basic-health-program-eligibility-levels/index.html) often have higher limits than expected ([KFF](https://www.kff.org/), 2025).

**State-specific programs**: Some states offer their own subsidies or public options (State Exchanges Directory, 2025).

**Employer or union coverage**: If you or your spouse has workplace coverage, reassess costs. It may now be cheaper than ACA plans.

**COBRA**: Recently left a job? Most [COBRA plans](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/cobra) extend your employer coverage up to 18 months. It's expensive but helpful during treatment transitions ([Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/), 2025).

## 4. Understand Alternative Options (and Their Serious Limitations)

Our previous provided insights on Health Coverage Outside the ACA in 2026. As costs rise, more people are turning to these plans. One [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) user summed it up: "The $10K we save on premiums will cover everything but catastrophe" (Reddit, Nov. 2025 thread on ACA rates).

Be very clear about what you're getting—and what you're giving up.

**Short-term health plans**:
✓ Lower premiums
✗ Exclude preexisting conditions
✗ Often don't cover prescriptions or maternity care
✗ Can have benefit caps

**Health care sharing ministries**:
✓ Lower monthly costs
✗ Not legally required to pay claims
✗ Can exclude treatments or have lifestyle restrictions
✗ No regulatory protections

**Direct primary care (DPC)**:
✓ Flat fee for primary care access
✗ Doesn't cover specialists or emergencies
Best used alongside a catastrophic plan, not instead of one.

## 5. If Going Uninsured Feels Inevitable

If you've exhausted every option, take steps to protect yourself:

**Build an emergency medical fund**: Even $50/month adds up. ER visits can reach $3,000+, broken bone can hit $10,000, emergency surgeries $100,000+ ([Healthcare Cost Institute](https://healthcostinstitute.org/), 2025).

**Use community resources**: [Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) offer sliding-scale fees; urgent care clinics post cash prices; programs like [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/), [RxSaver](https://www.rxsaver.com/) can reduce prescription costs.

**Ask about cash-pay discounts**: Providers often charge less for self-pay patients; ask for the "cash price." It's sometimes 40-60% less than the "rack rate."

**Consider limited benefit plans**: Accident or hospital indemnity plans pay fixed amounts for specific events. Partial protection is better than none.

**Know your rights**: Negotiate bills, request financial assistance, and set up payment plans. Hospitals prefer partial payments to none ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), 2025).

## 6. Make Your Voice Heard

This isn't just affecting one group; it's nationwide. The enhanced subsidies helped over 20 million people afford care as mentioned above. Their expiration is a policy choice, not an inevitability. This is a bipartisan issue affecting constituents in every district.

You can:

Contact your federal and state representatives about extending subsidies.

Share your story with local media or advocacy groups.

Support efforts for state public options or new subsidies.

As one [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) post put it: "Post your updated rates and get your representatives on the phone. It's just math. Can't hide behind it."

## Bottom Line

Going without insurance is a financial risk most people can't afford. [Medical debt](https://www.nclc.org/) remains a leading cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. ([National Consumer Law Center](https://www.nclc.org/), 2025). But for many, these are impossible choices when premiums could consume more and more of their household income.

Before you make any decisions:

Recalculate your subsidies for 2026

Compare every available plan, including catastrophic options

Check Medicaid eligibility and state programs

Understand what alternative plans actually cover

If you must go uninsured, have an emergency plan and build a medical fund
