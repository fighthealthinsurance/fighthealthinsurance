Turning 26 means getting kicked off your parent's health insurance plans. If your parents get insurance through the ACA marketplace, you can stay [covered](https://www.healthcare.gov/turning-26/) through December 31. If your parents are on their employer's insurance plan, you should check their specific rules — some plans end coverage at the end of your birthday month and others end on the day you turn 26.

Nearly one in seven 26-year-olds go uninsured. The consequences can be expensive: an unexpected ER visit can cost [thousands](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702975393/why-an-er-visit-can-cost-so-much-even-for-those-with-health-insurance) of dollars. And [several](https://workforce.equifax.com/all-blogs/-/post/what-do-individual-healthcare-mandates-look-like-in-your-state) states — Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and DC — require you to have insurance or you might face a tax penalty.

If you don't have coverage through work, you'll [need](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/insurance-cliff-age-26-young-adults-chaos/) to find a new plan to avoid being uninsured. That means navigating a complicated and costly health insurance market.

## Here's What to Know

### Figure Out When Your Coverage Ends
Your parents' plan might end on your birthday or at the end of that month (some may continue coverage if you are a full time student). Call the insurer to confirm. Knowing the exact date prevents gaps in coverage.

### Check If You Can Get Covered Through School or Work
If you're starting a new job, ask about health benefits and when they begin. Some graduate school or educational programs also offer coverage.

### Check If You Are Medicaid Eligible
If your income is low, Medicaid could provide free or low-cost coverage. Rules vary by state, and in most states you can apply year-round.

## Here's How to Sign Up

### Don't Miss Your Enrollment Window
Losing coverage triggers a 60-day window to enroll in a Marketplace plan through HealthCare.gov or your state's exchange. Licensed navigators and other assisters can help you through options. You can find them at [HealthCare.gov/localhelp](http://HealthCare.gov/localhelp) or by calling 1-800-318-2596.

### Shop Around and Compare Plans
Make sure your new plan's network includes your preferred providers and covers your medications at an affordable rate.

### Look Beyond the Premium
Premiums are what you pay per month, but you should also check deductibles (what you need to pay before insurance kicks in), copays (fixed amounts per visit), coinsurance (the percentage you pay for a service), and out-of-pocket maximums (the most you can pay in a year), especially if you have prescriptions or other health needs.
