### What Are Medicaid Work Requirements? {#what-are-medicaid-work-requirements}
Congress has passed new rules that will require many adult Medicaid beneficiaries to prove they are working or participating in other qualifying activities to keep their coverage. States must implement these requirements by December 31, 2026, though some may start sooner.

**Key Features:**
- **Minimum hours:** You must prove at least **80 hours per month** of work, job training, education, community service, or a combination of these activities.
- **Proof of compliance:** You may need to provide pay stubs, class schedules, or volunteer logs to verify your activities. More detailed rules will be released by the Department of Health and Human Services.
- **Age restrictions:** The rules generally apply to adults aged 19-64.

### Who Is Affected by These Requirements? {#who-is-affected-by-these-requirements}
The work requirements primarily target adults aged 19-64 who gained Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which covers low-income adults in 41 states and Washington, D.C.

#### Who Is Usually Exempt?
Most states are expected to offer exemptions for certain individuals, but these exemptions may not be automatic—you will likely need to apply and provide documentation. Common exemptions include:
- People who are pregnant or recently gave birth
- Parents or primary caregivers of young children
- People who are "medically frail" (i.e., have serious health conditions or disabilities)
- Students enrolled at least half-time
- Individuals receiving unemployment benefits or in substance abuse treatment

### How Will States Enforce These Rules? {#how-will-states-enforce-these-rules}

#### How will they check my hours?
When you apply, the state may "look back" one to three months to verify you met the requirement. After that, they will check at least once every six months. States are required to use payroll and other data "where possible," but the burden of proof will often fall on you.

#### What if I’m a seasonal worker?
You may still qualify. If your average monthly income over the last six months is equal to or greater than what you would earn working 80 hours per month at minimum wage, you are considered to have met the requirement.

### What If I Can't Work Right Now?
You should ask your state Medicaid agency about short-term “hardship” exceptions. These are designed for temporary situations, such as a caregiving crisis, a sudden illness, or needing to travel for serious medical care. You may also fit into one of the standard exemption categories.

### What Happens If I Fall Short? {#what-happens-if-i-fall-short}
If you don't meet the work requirement or fail to provide proof, you will receive a **30-day notice**. If you cannot prove you meet the rule or qualify for an exemption by the deadline, the state must deny or terminate your Medicaid coverage.

**Crucially, if you lose Medicaid for failing to meet the work requirement, you will not be eligible for subsidized health plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace, leaving you without a safety net.**

#### What are my rights if my coverage is at risk?
You have the right to appeal a denial or termination. This is often called a "fair hearing," and you can request one before your coverage officially ends.

### What Should I Do to Prepare? {#what-should-i-do-to-prepare}

#### Immediate Steps to Take:
1.  **Update your contact information** with your state's Medicaid agency so you don't miss important notices.
2.  **Review your eligibility status** and see if you qualify for an exemption.
3.  **Document your work activities**, school enrollment, or volunteer hours thoroughly.
4.  **Respond quickly** to any mail or requests from the Medicaid office.
5.  **Know your appeal rights** in case your coverage is unfairly terminated.

- **Career planning** may become tied to healthcare access
