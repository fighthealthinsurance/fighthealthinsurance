Hi there,

YOUR REMINDERS
--------------

We've set up reminders at strategic intervals:

* 2 days - Initial follow-up to check appeal status
* 30 days - Monthly check on appeal progress
* 90 days - Quarterly follow-up on appeal

IMPORTANT: ADD US TO YOUR CONTACTS!

HELPFUL REMINDER
----------------

These calendar reminders are helpful, but they're not perfect. We're a
small scrappy startup doing our best!

We recommend: Set your own reminders too, and save important documents
outside of Fight Health Insurance as a backup.
