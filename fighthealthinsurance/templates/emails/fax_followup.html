Hello {{name}},<br>
<p>
First off, thank you for using Fight Health Insurance to generate an appeal and choosing to use our fax service!
</p>
<p>
{% if success %}
Our records indicate the fax was sent successfully. You should still call your insurance company to confirm receipt as they love to try and weasel out of it.
{% elif missing_destination %}
It looks like we don't have a fax number on file for your appeal. This can happen if the fax number wasn't entered during checkout. Don't worry - you can enter the fax number now and we'll send your appeal right away!
{% else %}
It seems like there may have been a problem sending the fax. This is fairly common, but you can try to re-send the fax for free.
{% endif %}
</p>

<p>
{% if missing_destination %}

{% else %}
If you would like to re-send the fax, or send it to another number, <a href="{{fax_redo_link}}">click here</a>.
