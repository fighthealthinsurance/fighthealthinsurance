Hello {{name}},

First off, thank you for using Fight Health Insurance to generate an appeal and choosing to use our fax service!

{% if success %}
Our records indicate the fax was sent successfully. You should still call your insurance company to confirm receipt as they love to try and weasel out of it.
{% elif missing_destination %}
It looks like we don't have a fax number on file for your appeal. This can happen if there was an issue in out system or the fax number wasn't entered during checkout. Don't worry - you can enter the fax number now and we'll send your appeal right away!

ENTER YOUR FAX NUMBER HERE: {{fax_redo_link}}
{% else %}
It seems like there may have been a problem sending the fax. This is fairly common, but you can try to re-send the fax for free.
{% endif %}

{% if not missing_destination %}
If you would like to re-send the fax, or send it to another number, go to {{fax_redo_link}}
{% endif %}
