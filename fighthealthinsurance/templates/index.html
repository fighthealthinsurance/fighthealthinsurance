			  Navigating the insurance appeal process methodically is essential. The first step involves scanning your denial letter. This can be done through optical character recognition (OCR) either on <a class="link" href='{% url "scan" %}'>your device/phone (recommended for increased privacy)</a> or on <a class="link" href='{% url "server_side_ocr" %}'>our servers (more accurate)</a>. OCR makes the text understandable to machines, allowing our generative AI model able to produce potential appeals for you to choose from.

			<h4>Steps to Overturn Insurance Denial</h4>
			<ul>

			  <li>Thoroughly review the denial letter to understand the reasons provided by the insurance company.</li>
			  <li>Compile pertinent medical records, recommendations, and any additional documentation that supports your case.</li>
			  <li>Draft a comprehensive appeal letter, addressing each point of denial with factual and supportive evidence. <b>This is the step where we can help the most</b></li>
			  <li>Submit the appeal letter along with the compiled documents to the insurance company.</li>
