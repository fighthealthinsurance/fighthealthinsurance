    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        We are (exclusively) serving America, not because we don't love Europe, the rest of North America, Africa, or
        any other place in the world, but because, frankly, American health insurance is a special kind of SNAFU.
        <br><br>

        We at Totally Legit Co (of Delaware) decided to create "Fight Health Insurance" (sometimes called byâ€¦more colorful names)
        because we're tired of dealing with health insurance denials. In our opinion, many health insurance denials are bogus, and
        the insurance companies depend on us not appealing. We hope that by making it easier to appeal medical health insurance denials,
        we can change that calculus on insurance companies' part.
        <br><br>

        This website is not intended to be legal advice. We focus on providing information on how to appeal health
        insurance claims. In some situations with Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), you may have the right to legal action and should consult with a lawyer.
        <br><br>

        We also intend to offer a paid version for doctors, therapists, and other practitioner offices, hospitals, etc. since they deal with so many denials.
        If that sounds like you (or your business), we would love <a href="{% url 'pro_version' %}">to keep in touch</a> (and optionally, a small amount of
        money if you are interested in being a first beta user).

            <p>Holden Karau is a Canadian-born trans-woman living in America who's been working in tech for more than a decade.
            She's experienced the "joys" of American health insurance and helps her friends & loved ones navigate the seemingly random maze of disappointment and sadness.
            Her dislike of health insurance companies treating her loved ones unfairly led her to create Fight Health Insurance.
            Outside of fighting insurance companies and keeping them accountable, she rides motorcycles, works with big data and machine learning to pay the bills*,
            spends time with her loved ones (most of all Professor Timbit), and dances to mashup music (or happy-hard-core if you're old enough to remember that). You can also follow her on all of the usual social media places where she talks about a mixture of these things (and sometimes live streams working on Fight Health Insurance) -- <a href=""></a>.
