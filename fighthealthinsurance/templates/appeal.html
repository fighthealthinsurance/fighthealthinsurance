  Many health insurance companies choose these because they <i>believe</i> you don't have a fax machine or the time to send a letter by post mail. Thankfully there are many low cost ways to send faxes OR even mail letters directly from your phone. One service we have used before is <a href="https://faxzero.com/">FaxZero</a>, although it is limited to only a few pages. Your ISP may also offer free fax service (for example <a href="https://members.sonic.net/labs/fax/">Sonic does</a> and <a href="http://sonic.com/referral/499545hfh">holden has a referral link if you happen to be in their service area</a>).
