Huzzah! We have a <b>draft</b> appeal for you to edit bellow:

<textarea style="width:100%" rows="20" name="appeal_text" id="appeal_text">
{{appeal}}
</textarea>

<p>
  Once your satisified it's time to send in your appeal! Your denial should include the mailing address, fax number, or e-mail to submit your appeal to.
</p>
<p>
  Many health insurance companies choose these because they <i>believe</i> you don't have a fax machine or the time to send a letter by post mail. Thankfully there are many low cost ways to send faxes OR even mail letters directly from your phone.
