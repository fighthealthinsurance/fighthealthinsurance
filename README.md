# fighthealthinsurance

This is the django interface for [Fight Health Insurance a health insurance appeal bot](https://www.fighthealthinsurance.com/).

Currently this has both the frontend (HTML & javascript) along with a bunch of "middle-ware" type logic (forms, database interactions, etc.)

In the future this may be seperated out into different projects.

The [ML model is generated using this repo](https://github.com/totallylegitco/healthinsurance-llm).
