The federal public comment period closed May 9, 2025.<br>

**Population.** The waiver would impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion adults. The requirements would apply to expansion adults aged 19-54 who do not qualify for an exemption. <br>

**Strategy.** Individuals would be required to verify compliance with work requirements monthly (i.e., report qualifying activities for at least 20 hours / week). The amendment also proposes a five-year lifetime limit on Medicaid coverage for individuals subject to the work requirement (time out of compliance with the work requirement would count toward the lifetime limit) and a one-year ban for individuals who “knowingly” fail to report a change in family income or who make false statements regarding their work status.<br>

**Consequence.** Individuals subject to the requirements who do not secure an exemption or successfully demonstrate compliance with the requirements would have an initial 6-month grace period; a two-month suspension from coverage would follow the grace period (if compliance is not demonstrated).

**Population.** The waiver would impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion adults. The requirements would apply to expansion adults ages 19-64, with no exemptions. <br>

**Strategy.** The proposal is similar to the state’s [previous](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demonstrations/downloads/ar-arhome-pa-06022023.pdf) “Opportunities for Success” amendment proposed in 2023 (which was never approved and was withdrawn by the state in March 2025).

Individuals identified as “not on track” would be assigned a “Success Coach,” who may develop and monitor a “personal development plan” to track goals related to “being healthy,” employment, “advancement,” and/or “service.”  <br>

**Consequence.** Individuals who do not meet program requirements (who “refuse to cooperate” with the state) would have their coverage suspended through the end of the calendar year.

Full coverage for noncitizens which include DACA recipients is dependent on the availability of state funding. However, noncitizens (residing legally or illegally) can qualify for coverage for emergencies and labor & delivery services if income requirements are met. Income Level – Qualifying for Medicaid is also based on need. Household income must be under certain limits as defined by the Federal Poverty Level and is based on family size. For Long Term Care programs, financial resources must also be under a certain amount. There are also specific programs for individuals who meet certain medical or disability tests, or who qualify due to age or pregnancy.

{""question"": ""Q. How much income can I receive and still be eligible for Medicaid?"", ""answer"": ""A. Income is money that you get from working, or money that someone gives you, or checks that you receive, such as a Social Security check, unemployment benefits, child support, retirement benefits, or sick pay. Whether your income level qualifies you or your family for Medicaid depends on the size of your family and the Medicaid program for which you are applying. Income limits are set each year by the federal government to define the Federal Poverty Level for different family sizes. In general, if your household income is at or below the current 100% Federal Poverty Level for your household size, your family is likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Children from age 1 to under age 6 can qualify for Medicaid benefits when household income is at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level . Pregnant women and infants under age 1 qualify for Medicaid with family income at or below the 200% Federal Poverty Level , and pregnant women count as 2 (or more) family members. See our tables of income limits for applying for DMMA programs to find out where your family income is, in relation to these income benchmarks. Medical assistance programs other than Medicaid have different income level requirements. For example, uninsured children under age 19 who live in families with incomes at or below the 200% Federal Poverty Level are eligible for low cost health insurance under the Delaware Healthy Children Program . If you need help with medical payments, you may qualify for one of many other medical assistance programs. If you don’t know which program you need, a good first step would be to call the Delaware HelpLine toll-free at 1-800-464-HELP (4357)."", ""state"": ""Delaware"", ""source_url"": ""https://dhss.delaware.gov/dmma/faqs/"", ""fetched"": ""2025-06-24""}

If your income is low, and you have minor children, you and your children can have private health insurance and still be eligible for Medicaid.

If you have both private health insurance and Medicaid, you should show both your Medicaid card and your private health insurance card to your medical provider each time you receive services."", ""state"": ""Delaware"", ""source_url"": ""https://dhss.delaware.gov/dmma/faqs/"", ""fetched"": ""2025-06-24""}

**Population.** The demonstration [waiver](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medicaid-work-requirements-are-back-on-agenda/) expands eligibility to parents 35-100% FPL and childless adults 0-100% FPL. This is not a full Medicaid expansion under the ACA and does not qualify for enhanced federal matching funds. Work requirements apply to adults aged 19-64 without exemptions.<br>

**Strategy.** Applicants must complete a minimum of 80 hours of qualifying activities *before* Medicaid coverage begins. As a condition of maintaining Medicaid eligibility, beneficiaries are required to continue meeting the qualifying hours and activities requirement and report compliance monthly.<br>

**Consequence.** Initial and continued enrollment is conditioned on compliance with work requirements.<br>

Georgia is seeking to renew / extend its “Pathways to Coverage” waiver. The federal public comment period closed June 1, 2025.

Renewal Changes. The state is seeking changes in its waiver renewal application including allowing parents / caretakers of children up to age 6 (in households at or below 100% FPL) to receive Medicaid without work requirements and eliminating the requirement to monthly report work activities (in exchange for annual reporting). The state would perform “periodic and random audits” to monitor enrollee continued compliance with eligibility requirements, including work requirements. The state also seeks to remove premium requirements (which were never implemented).","{""question"": ""Still not sure?"", ""answer"": ""Call 1-800-GEORGIA to verify that a website is an official website of the State of Georgia."", ""state"": ""Georgia"", ""source_url"": ""https://medicaid.georgia.gov/organization/about-georgia-medicaid/medicaid-faqs"", ""fetched"": ""2025-06-24""}

The federal public comment period will close July 13, 2025. A bill directing the state to pursue work requirements also states that if the state receives approval to add work requirements as a condition for eligibility, the state will discontinue the expansion program if federal law or regulations are later modified to exclude work requirements.<br> 

**Population.** The waiver would impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion adults. The requirements would apply to expansion adults aged 19-64 who do not qualify for an exemption. <br>

**Strategy.** New applicants will not have to comply with work requirements to gain initial Medicaid eligibility. The state will verify that individuals meet an exemption or are in compliance with work requirements (i.e., qualifying activities of at least 100 hours / month or earned wages at least equal to the state minimum wage multiplied by 100 hours) every six months, starting six months after initial enrollment or at renewal for existing enrollees. Iowa will use information from existing systems to confirm compliance; individuals would have to verify compliance with work requirements in cases where the state does not have sufficient information. <br>

**Consequences.** Individuals subject to the requirements who do not meet or do not report qualifying activities at the time of compliance checks will have their coverage suspended, followed by disenrollment at renewal (if still not in compliance with requirements).","{""question"": ""Medicaid Eligibility"", ""answer"": ""Medicaid is a health insurance program based on income. In addition to meeting certain income levels, you need to meet specific eligibility requirements to receive Medicaid coverage. The following are some of these general requirements: A child under the age of 21 A parent living with a child under the age of 18 A woman who is pregnant A woman in need of treatment for breast or cervical cancer A person who is elderly (age 65 or older) A person who is disabled according to Social Security standards An adult between the ages of 19 and 64 and whose income is at or below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) A person who is a resident of Iowa and a U.S. citizen Others may qualify (see list below)"", ""state"": ""Iowa"", ""source_url"": ""https://hhs.iowa.gov/programs/welcome-iowa-medicaid/iowa-medicaid-programs"", ""fetched"": ""2025-06-24""}

The federal comment period closed April 7, 2025.<br>

**Population.** The waiver would condition Medicaid expansion coverage on meeting work requirements. <br>

**Strategy.** To qualify for coverage individuals would have to satisfy one of five criteria (at initial application and renewal): be employed (individuals with household earned income will be presumed to be employed), be over age 55, be enrolled in school or a job training program, be participating in alcohol/drug addiction treatment program, or have intensive physical health care needs or serious mental illness (SMI).  <br>

The waiver request indicates the state would use available data (from Ohio’s eligibility and enrollment system) to identify individuals who meet one or more of the five pre-enrollment criteria, instead of requiring regular reporting by enrollees. For individuals that cannot be verified with available state data, Ohio would employ a third-party vendor to verify eligibility requirements using “external data sources.” Individuals would be required to confirm or dispute the data provided by this vendor to county case workers.<br>

**Consequence.** Individuals must meet at least one eligibility criteria at initial application to enroll and at renewal to maintain coverage.",

If you are an adult in this age group and your monthly income for just you is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level a month (see chart here ), you may be eligible for Medicaid affordable care coverage through a Rhody Health Partner’s plan. How to Apply . Medicaid and HealthSource RI work together using Rhode Island’s state-of-the-art eligibility system created for health reform. This web-based system determines eligibility for most types of Medicaid and other forms of affordable coverage using a single, streamlined application.

The good news is that HealthSource RI will point you in the right direction if that is what is best for you after asking just a few questions.

South Carolina,South Carolina Department of Health & Human Services (SCDHHS),(888) 549-0820,https://www.scdhhs.gov/,South Carolina Legal Services,(888) 346-5592,https://www.scdhhs.gov,released,"South Carolina is proposing a [new](https://www.scdhhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Palmetto%20Pathways%20to%20Independence%20Draft%20Waiver%20for%20Submission.pdf) 1115 demonstration waiver called “Palmetto Pathways to Independence.” The state [public comment](https://www.scdhhs.gov/communications/public-notice-south-carolina-department-health-and-human-services-palmetto-pathways) period closed May 31, 2025.<br>

**Population.** The demonstration waiver would expand eligibility to parents/caretakers 67-100% FPL. (This is not a full Medicaid expansion under the ACA and would not qualify for enhanced federal matching funds.) Work requirements would apply to parents/caretakers aged 19-64.<br>

**Strategy.** Applicants must complete a minimum of 80 hours of qualifying activities before Medicaid coverage begins. South Carolina would attempt to use information from existing systems (data matching) to confirm compliance with requirements; however, individuals would have to verify compliance with work requirements in cases where the state does not have sufficient information. Enrollment would be capped at 11,400 parent/caretakers and a wait list would be established for eligible individuals that exceed the cap. ([KFF estimates](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/how-many-uninsured-are-in-the-coverage-gap-and-how-many-could-be-eligible-if-all-states-adopted-the-medicaid-expansion/) 65,000 adults with incomes below 100% FPL currently fall into the “coverage gap” in SC).<br>

**Consequence.** Initial and continued enrollment would be conditioned on compliance with work requirements. Individuals’ eligibility at annual renewal would be reviewed for compliance with work requirements. Individuals found out of compliance would be disenrolled from coverage. (To regain coverage, disenrolled individuals would need to reapply.) Individuals reporting a “change of circumstance” prior to annual renewal would be disenrolled if found non-compliant with work requirements.

**Population.** The waiver would impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion adults. The requirements would apply to expansion adults aged 19-64 who do not qualify for an exemption.<br>

**Strategy.** Applicants must complete qualifying activities before Medicaid coverage begins (hours requirement not specified). South Dakota will use information from existing systems (data matching) to confirm compliance; individuals would have to verify compliance with work requirements in cases where the state does not have sufficient information.Individuals’ eligibility at renewal would be reviewed for compliance with work requirements.<br>

**Consequences.** Individuals found out of compliance would be denied at application or disenrolled from coverage. Individuals would need to reapply to regain / gain coverage. (If the individual meets requirements or exemption criteria within 90 days of disenrollment, they may be reinstated with retroactive coverage starting the first day of month the exemption/participation requirements applied.)","{""question"": ""What is South Dakota Medicaid?"", ""answer"": ""Medicaid is a federal and state-funded  program providing health coverage for people who meet certain eligibility  standards.

**Strategy.** Non-exempt individuals must complete the following activities within three months (following the month of enrollment): register for work, complete an employment training assessment and assigned job training, and apply to jobs with at least 48 employers. Non-exempt individuals would be required to meet requirements annually (at eligibility renewal). <br>

**Consequences.** Failure to meet the requirements would result in suspension of Medicaid coverage for three months. During the suspension period, individuals could regain coverage (retroactive to the first day of the suspension) if required work activities are completed or if found to meet exemption criteria. Individuals who do not meet requirements (or satisfy exemption criteria) by the end of the three-month suspension period, would be terminated from coverage and “locked out” until eligibility renewal. Individuals terminated from coverage could reapply and regain coverage if they can demonstrate compliance with work requirements, but coverage would not be retroactive (beyond the first day of the month in which they reapply). (The state indicates it would “consider” retroactive coverage for individuals terminated who later are found to meet an exemption.)","{""question"": ""Q: How do I know if a code requires prior authorization?"", ""answer"": ""A Coverage and Reimbursement Lookup Tool opens in a new tab"", ""state"": ""Utah"", ""source_url"": ""https://medicaid.utah.gov/frequently-asked-questions/"", ""fetched"": ""2025-06-24""}
